# Car-Prediction (Group B1) - Kristo Kontse, Gregor Uustalu
Database we are using: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meruvulikith/90000-cars-data-from-1970-to-2024/data

## Motivation

The used car market is large, dynamic, and influenced by many factors such as mileage, age, brand and overall vehicle condition. Because of this complexity, it is often difficult for buyers, sellers, and dealerships to accurately estimate a fair price for a vehicle. Traditional pricing methods rely heavily on manual assessment or outdated valuation tables, which can lead to inconsistent or inaccurate results.

Machine learning offers a powerful solution by analyzing large amounts of historical data and identifying patterns that influence car prices. By using different models, it becomes possible to build a system that delivers fast, objective, and reliable price predictions.

## Our goal
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning–based models and program which is capable of predicting used car prices. 
To achieve this, we use different models (such as Random Forest and LightGBM) to estimate the valuation of the cars.

1 Task - Cleaned the database and removed useless values. <br>
2 Task - Data analyzis, made graphs to show correlations and visualize data.
